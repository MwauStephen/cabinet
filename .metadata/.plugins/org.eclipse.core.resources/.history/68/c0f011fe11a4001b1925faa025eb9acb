//a linked list stores a list of objects(nodes) in sequence
//they can grow and shrink automatically
//each node holds two pieces of data i.e value and address(address of next node)
//first node->head
//second node->tail
//nodes of a linked list can be scattered all over the memory hence difficult to access an item with its index
//new operator used in creating objects is used to allocate memory
